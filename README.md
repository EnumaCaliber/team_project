- only have to answer 1 question provided, but make it more detailed
- 500 word count is not including code - only written part
- highly recommend using a GitHub repository with the group to code, but you cannot all work on it at the same time
- columns that have binary variables are not the best to use
- TAs will not answer questions like: what column should i use? or what method of wrangling?

- can be regression, classification, clustering etc. questions
