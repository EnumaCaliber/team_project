- only have to answer 1 question provided, but make it more detailed
- 500 word count is not including code - only written part
- highly recommend using a GitHub repository with the group to code, but you cannot all work on it at the same time
- columns that have binary variables are not the best to use
- TAs will not answer questions like: what column should i use? or what method of wrangling?
- for individual project proposal: read in data, clean and wrangle data, do summary statistics, graphs + charts, write out methods in words
- it's okay if methods are different, in the end you will merge together your ideas
- can be regression, classification, clustering etc. questions
